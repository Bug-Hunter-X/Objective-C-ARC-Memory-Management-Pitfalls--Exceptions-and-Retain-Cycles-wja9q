To address the memory leak issue, utilize `@try`/`@catch` blocks to ensure proper cleanup even if exceptions occur:

```objectivec
@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    @try {
        self.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
        // ... code that might throw an exception ...
    } @catch (NSException *exception) {
        // Handle the exception
        self.myString = nil; // Explicitly release the string
    } @finally {
        //This block will always execute
    }
}
@end
```

For delegate-related retain cycles, declare delegate properties as `weak`:

```objectivec
@interface MyViewController : UIViewController
@property (weak, nonatomic) id <MyDelegate> delegate;
@end
```
Using `weak` ensures that the delegate is not retained by the view controller, preventing the retain cycle.  Always ensure that you use `weak` references when possible to avoid unnecessary retain cycles.
